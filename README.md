# Perplexity Dual-Engine Search Strategy

**A strategic blueprint demonstrating how Perplexity AI can compete with Google Search through a dual-engine architecture.**

## ðŸ”— Live Interactive Demo

**[Explore the Interactive Mockup](https://bharathirajaj.github.io/perplexity_dual_engine_mockup/mockup_interactive.html)**

## Overview

This repository contains a high-fidelity interactive mockup showcasing a dual-engine search architecture for Perplexity AI. The concept combines traditional instant search (40%) with AI-powered synthesis (60%) to deliver both speed and intelligence in a single unified interface.

## ðŸ“„ Full Strategic Analysis

**â†’ [Read the complete strategy: STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md)**

The strategy document includes:
- Market analysis and Google's weaknesses
- Technical architecture breakdown  
- Query distribution data (40-50% navigational, 20-30% informational)
- 3-phase implementation roadmap
- Cost modeling (AI vs traditional search economics)
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Enterprise wedge opportunity

**tl;dr:** AI search costs 8-10Ã— more than traditional indexing. By routing simple queries to instant search and complex queries to AI, Perplexity can serve all user needs sustainably while challenging Google's dominance.

### Why Dual-Engine?

Google's search market share dipped below 90% for the first time in a decade. Users are fragmenting between:
- **Google** for speed (navigational queries)
- **Perplexity** for understanding (complex research)

The dual-engine approach captures both use cases, making Perplexity a universal search destination.

## Key Features

âœ¨ **Interactive Features:**
- Click any citation number â†’ Auto-scrolls to source card
- Toggle between Dual/Instant/AI modes in real-time
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Ctrl+Enter/Alt+Enter)
- Live streaming animation showing AI synthesis progress
- Clickable example queries with simulated results

ðŸ“Š **Dual-Engine Architecture:**
- **Left Panel (40%):** Instant search results in ~118ms
- **Right Panel (60%):** AI synthesis with inline citations
- **Smart Routing:** Automatic engine selection based on query type
- **Metrics Dashboard:** Real-time SLO tracking (routing accuracy, latency, token speed)

ðŸŽ¨ **Design Elements:**
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Dark mode support
- Source credibility scoring
- Peer-review badges and confidence indicators

```

## The Strategy

The dual-engine approach solves Perplexity's key challenge: users switch back to Google for quick navigational queries ("facebook login", "amazon", "UTC to IST"). By integrating instant search alongside AI synthesis, Perplexity can:

1. **Serve all query types:** Navigational (40-50%), Informational (20-30%), Transactional (10-20%), Complex (10-20%)
2. **Improve economics:** Route simple queries to low-cost instant search, reserve expensive AI for complex queries
3. **Increase stickiness:** Eliminate the need to switch between search engines

## Market Context

- Google's market share: <90% (first time since 2015)
- Perplexity's growth: 780M+ monthly queries
- Distribution: Comet browser (millions MAU) + Airtel partnership (350M+ subscribers in India)
- Opportunity: $500B annual search market

## Technical Implementation

**No dependencies required** - Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

The mockup demonstrates:
- Query routing logic
- Parallel engine execution (instant + AI)
- Real-time streaming simulation
- Citation linking and source cards
- Responsive layout adaptation
